# TODO-LIST-APP

I build this app through my web developer bootcamp course form Udemy. 
It's a jQuery based To Do App, but it's really focus on CSS and styling
with some animation, some effects. Overall it's a polished application.

	we can resize. as you hoover over the item you get the option to click on delete icon and delete things.

	But you can check off an item if you want to keep it there. 

	you also have an icon that let's you see the app on either edit or view mode. 
					More Practice With:
			jQuery:
				.on()
				.keypress()
				Fades and Slides
				Selecting
				.parent()
				.append()
				Creating Elements
				Event Delegation
			CSS:
				Margin
				Padding
				Float
				Fonts
				Font-Awesome
				Box-Shadow
				Transition
				Gradients
